				<h6> The Soundless Silence of Elijah Carr (1992-2020) </h6>
				<p>In loving memory of Elijah Carr, who lost his connection to the world of sound and,
					eventually, to himself. Elijah Carr was a passionate musician and music lover,
					known for his eclectic taste in genres and his deep emotional connection to sound.
					However, in his late 20s, Elijah made the fateful decision to stop exploring new
					music altogether. </p> <p>What began as a simple decision to repeat his favorite songs
					soon turned into a gradual retreat from music itself. He would no longer listen to the
					sounds that once filled his life with joy, reflection, and expression. Those closest to
					him noticed a subtle change. His once vibrant, expressive face began to lose its
					liveliness. His smile disappeared. His eyes, once filled with curiosity and wonder,
					became distant. His voice grew quiet, no longer animated by the excitement of
					music. </p> <p> By the time Elijah turned 30, his face had become nearly unrecognizable—
					his expressions frozen, as though he no longer knew how to convey feeling. He was
					diagnosed with *Music Deprivation Syndrome,* a new and rare condition affecting
					those who have lost their emotional connection to music. The lack of musical
					engagement had rendered him emotionally distant and physically changed, as
					though his very soul had retreated from the world.</p> <p>In his final years, Elijah dedicated
					himself to raising awareness about the importance of music for emotional wellbeing. He founded the *Emotional Frequency Research Institute* which
					encouraged people to explore new music and reconnect with the inner landscapes
					of their minds through sound. Elijah's legacy lives on through this website and our
					research into the effects of music—or the lack thereof—on the human mind and
					body.</p> <p>His story serves as a stark reminder of the power music holds, not only to
					shape our emotions but to maintain the very fabric of our humanity.
				 “When the music fades, so too do we.”—Elijah Carr, 2020
