     <p class= "poe">  Journalist Kate Wagner dives deep into the internet and its evolution; this essay, of course, is drenched in nostalgia. She begins with the observation that today's internet has deprioritized user experience, in favor of other agendas on the internet. Wagner draws on a powerful  quote from the Internet Historian and artist Olia Lailiana stating, “. . . we’ve studied the history of hypertext, but not the history of Metallica fan web rings or web rings in general.” This puts into perspective the often-overlooked aspects of the internet's true nature while highlighting how far the internet has strayed from its organic, user-driven experiences. </p> 

     <p> Wagner goes on to define Web 1.0, noting its unique relationship between users and the internet.  She describes it as a period that was “... exciting, naive, futuristic, and quite limited” as a creative medium. Born in 2003, I experienced some of the tail end of this era, marked by low-quality images, bright colors, a plethora of ads, and the early phases of internet culture- iFunny, Trollface, Minecraft, and heaps of memes. The early internet, though looked at as basic by today's standards, offered a space for raw creativity. Users could manipulate and curate their own niche online world. Wagner's description feels spot-on to anyone who witnessed the clunky web at that time. </p>   

     <p>She shifts to Web 2.0, highlighting the transformation from customizable and interactive to polished and impersonal. She writes, “Web 2.0, on the other hand, erases that relationship by making the system transparent, the programmable workings of the internet—the internet as a medium—a “native” thing to be “experienced” rather than explicitly interacted with.” The magic of personal expression was overshadowed by sleek, professionalized platforms that instead of being shaped by the users, are shaped for them. What ends up being lost in translation is the ability to create freely, without design restraints or premade formats. They envied Myspace's ability to add glitter, dancing gifs, skull backgrounds, music, etc, and over time ended up giving into the minimalistic modern era of the internet, as did the rest of the world. </p>

  

     <p> Wagner's balanced perspective shines though as she references Danah Boyd's essay, which dives into the Myspace and early Facebook eras. Boyd points out the contrasting views on these aesthetics by saying “In essence, the “glitter”produced by those who “pimp out” their MySpaces [Boyd acknowledges the racialized attributes of this language] is seen by some in a positive light while others see it as “gaudy,” “tacky,” and “cluttered.”  While Facebook fans loved the site’s aesthetic minimalism, others viewed this tone as “boring,” “lame,” and “elitist.”,  This contrast points out, that while we may favor the vibrant and personalized early days of the web, there will always be differing opinions on what the “better” design is. Though aesthetic opinions always vary, the artifacts of Web 1.0 give us a window into the time when the internet was collectively shaped by individuals. What shines through is the richness of that era's raw creativity.  </p>

  

     <p> Wagner concludes by referencing Fredric Jameson’s Post-modernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism, to underscore her argument. Jameson in writing in 1991 stated, “For with the collapse of the high-modernist ideology of style—what is as unique and unmistakable as your own fingerprints, as incomparable as your own body [e.g. MySpace, Geocities pages] . . . the producers of culture [big Internet companies] have nowhere to turn but to the past: the imitation of dead styles [glitter graphics, Geocities], speech through all the masks and voices stored up in the imaginary museum of a now global culture [the whole internet].”, mind-blowing writing. Wagner's annotations help crystalize her argument and leave a lasting impression. </p>
